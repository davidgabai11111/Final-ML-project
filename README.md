# Final Machine Learning Project

## Description
Final project for the Machine Learning course.  
The objective is to predict asset performance using interpretable financial features and machine learning models.

## Methods
- Feature engineering (momentum, volatility, reversal)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Evaluation metrics: F1-score, Sharpe ratio, CAGR

## Tools
- Python
- Google Colab
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Code format
The project is provided both as a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and as a Python script (`.py`).  
The notebook can be opened and executed interactively using the **Open in Colab** button.

## Dataset

The financial data used in this project is obtained programmatically using the `yfinance` Python library, which retrieves data from Yahoo Finance.
Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/
The dataset can be reproduced by running the data collection cells in the notebook.
